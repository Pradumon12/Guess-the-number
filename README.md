# Guess-the-number
This game generates a random number and then prompts the player to guess what it is. It will continue to accept guesses until either the player guesses the number or they run out of guesses. If the player runs out of guesses, the game will end and let the player know that they lost. Otherwise, if the player guesses the number correctly, the game will end and let the player know that they won.
